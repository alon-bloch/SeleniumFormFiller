# SeleniumFormFiller
This Python project uses Selenium and Faker to automate form submissions. It validates system stability and data integrity by generating unique, random data (names, emails, phone numbers, file paths) and automatically filling and submitting the form multiple times. Essential for QA and testing form submission rate limits.
